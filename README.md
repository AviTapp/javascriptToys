javascriptToys
==============

As I work my way through CodeAcademy.com and similar sites, I find a need to review and stretch the knowledge I'm gaining. Normally I would do this through exercises, but those seem hard to find. A friend suggested finding small projects to try to build, so this repo is where I plan to keep my projects/toys/experiments/etc.
